    "#### `FILE` section\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines starting with `FILE` indicate that the line specifies the geometry and type of one interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first arguement after `FILE` determines the relative path to the interface mesh files, `filename.vert` and `filename.face`. `filename.vert` containes the location of the vertices of the disretized traingular elements and `filename.vert` is the connectivity table for the vertices. The `*.face` and `*.vert` files can be generated using Michael Sanner's Molecular Surface program <a href=\"http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads#msms\">`MSMS`</a>. This link shows an example on how to use `MSMS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for more than one surface (ie. for Stern layers, solvent filled cavities, several proteins), more than one FILE line is needed. For instance, the sample <a href=\"#config_file_example\">config</a> file accounts for two surface, described in lines 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `filename`, the user must specify what kind of surface the `filename` describes. It can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -  `stern_layer`: surface separates Stern layer (region shown in light blue) from solvent\n",
    "  -  `dielectric_interface`: surface separates low dielectric (inside protein shown in light yellow) and high dielectric (outside protein) regions.\n",
    "  -  `internal_cavity`: surface is an internal cavity (a result of `'-all_components'` flag in `MSMS`). This is important to specify because by default `MSMS` changes the vertex ordering for internal cavities.\n",
    "  -  `dirichlet_surface`: surface of specified potential. The value of this potential is read from a text file which has to be specified next to *'dirichlet_surface'*.\n",
    "  -  `neumann_surface`: surface of specified potential. The value of this potential is read from a text file which has to be specified next to *'neumann_surface'*.\n",

    "- the kind of surface which is `stern_layer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the second line in the sample <a href=\"#config_file_example\">config</a> file specifies this information for the dielectric interface (shown with thick black line in the schematic). \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance in the sample <a href=\"#config_file_example\">config</a> file, the first line in the `FIELD` section describes the properties of solvent as an infinite region (region `III` in the schematic). Because the solvent region is infinite and not bounded by another surface, the `parent` parameter takes the value `NA`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the second line in the `FIELD` section corresponds to the Stern layer (shown in light blue in the schematic). This region is bounded by the Stern surface, therefore, the `parent` parameter takes the value `0` because the Stern surface is the first surface (hence the `0` index) defined in the `FILE` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Nchild`: number of child surfaces, i.e., surfaces completely contained in this region. The Stern surface in the schematic is completely contained in the solvent region `III` so the `Nchild` parameter for the solvent region is `1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the dielectric surface is contained in the Stern layer (region `II`) so the `Nchild` parameter for the Stern layer is `1`.\n",
