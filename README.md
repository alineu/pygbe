# PyGBe: Python GPU code for Boundary elements

This is a boundary element method code that does molecular electrostatics 
calculations with a continuum approach. It calculates solvation energies for 
proteins modeled with any number of dielectric regions. We use the formulation 
presented in the paper by Yoon and Lenhoff: ["A Boundary Element Method for Molecular 
Electrostatics with Electrolyte Effects", Journal of Computational Chemistry, 
Vol. 11, No. 9, 1990](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.540110911). Proper user guide is under development.

This code is accelerated using the Barnes-Hut treecode so that each GMRES 
iteration scales as O(NlogN).
The code is written in Python putting the most computationally intensive 
parts on the GPU, interfacing with PyCUDA, and some parts are wrapped in 
C++ using SWIG. 

## Installation

The following instructions assume that the operating system is Ubuntu. Run the 
corresponding commands in your flavor of Linux to install.

### Dependencies (last tested)
* Python 2.7.11
* Numpy 1.10.4
* SWIG 3.0.8
* NVCC 7.0 
* PyCUDA 2015.1.3

#### Python
Python is available by default on Ubuntu.

#### Numpy and SWIG

Install numpy and SWIG by running 
the following in the command line:

    > sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig

#### NVCC

[Download and install](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) the CUDA Toolkit.

#### PyCUDA

PyCUDA must be installed from source. Follow the [instructions](http://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation) on the PyCUDA website.
We summarize the commands to install PyCUDA on Ubuntu here:

    > cd $HOME
    > mkdir src
    > cd src
    > wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pycuda/pycuda-2015.1.3.tar.gz
    > tar -xvzf pycuda-2015.1.3.tar.gz
    > cd pycuda-2015.1.3
    > python configure.py --cuda-root=/usr/local/cuda
    > make
    > sudo make install

Test the installation by running the following:

    > cd test
    > python test_driver.py

PyGBe has been run and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.10 and 15.04. 

### Compiling PyGBe

Create a clone of the repository on your machine:

    > cd $HOME/src
    > git clone https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe.git
    > cd pygbe

To compile the C++ code, type `make all` in the `./bem_pycuda` directory:

    > cd bem_pycuda
    > make all

## Run PyGBe

To run a case, type `./main.py <file1.param> <file2.config>` in the folder `./bem_pycuda`. Replace `file1` and `file2` with the corresponding names of the input files. As an example, run the following:

    > ./main.py input_files/lys.param input_files/lys.config

### Mesh
In `./geometry`, we provide the meshes and `.pqr` files for a spherical molecule 
and the Lysozyme protein. To plug in your own protein data, download the 
corresponding `.pdb` file from the Protein Data Bank, then get its `.pqr` file 
using any PDB to PQR converter (there are online tools available for this). 
Our code interfaces with meshes generated using [MSMS (Michel Sanner's 
Molecular Surface code)](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS).  

### Input files
In `./bem_pycuda/input_files`, we provide example input files. For a run 
you need two input files: a "parameters" file and a "config" file. 
Documentation on the format of these files is provided in the file 
`README_input_format`.

Let us know if you have any questions/feedback.

Enjoy!
